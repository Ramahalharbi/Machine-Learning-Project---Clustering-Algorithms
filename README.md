# Machine Learning Project - ClusteringAlgorithms

# Introduction
This project focuses on implementing and applying two unsupervised machine learning clustering algorithmsâ€”KMeans and DBSCAN. These algorithms are designed to group data points based on their similarity, providing insights into underlying patterns within datasets.

# Algorithms Overview


# KMeans
KMeans is a centroid-based clustering algorithm. It aims to divide a given dataset into K clusters, where each cluster represents a collection of related data points. The algorithm assigns data points to the closest centroid iteratively and updates centroids based on the new clusters.

# DBSCAN

DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) is a density-based clustering method. Unlike KMeans, DBSCAN identifies clusters based on data point density and can find clusters of any shape. It does not require the number of clusters to be provided beforehand and can handle datasets with varying densities.




# Project Objectives

1. Apply Machine Learning algorithms to analyze different scenarios.
2. Appreciate how tools from Probability, Statistics, Calculus, and Linear Algebra are combined to build learning algorithms.
3. Translate theory into practice using open-source or commercial software tools to build machine learning solutions.
4. Apply unsupervised learning techniques, specifically clustering, to identify meaningful clusters in datasets.
5. Analyze the output for a better understanding and decision-making.


# Datasets

To demonstrate the effectiveness of the clustering algorithms, three custom datasets are generated:

Dataset1: Blobs Dataset
Dataset2: Anisotropically Distributed Dataset
Dataset3: Noisy Moons Dataset
Dataset4: Noisy Circles Dataset


# Results

The quality of clustering will be evaluated using external indices to compare the performance of the KMeans and DBSCAN algorithms.
